# 👻 Find the Phantom - A Bayesian Inference Game

**Find the Phantom** is a Python-based interactive game where players must locate the phantom on an **8x13 grid**. The game provides feedback using a **distance sensor** that changes colors based on proximity to the phantom.

---

## 🎯 Game Mechanics
- **Click a cell** to receive feedback on how close you are to the phantom.
- The game uses **Bayesian Inference** to update probabilities after each move.
- Players start with **10 points and 2 attempts**.
- The game ends when you **find the phantom or run out of points/attempts**.

## 🌈 Color-Based Feedback
| Color         | Meaning  |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| 🟣 **Purple** | Phantom is at the clicked position. |
| 💗 **Pink**   | 1-2 cells away. |
| 💛 **Yellow** | 3-4 cells away. |
| 💚 **Light Green** | 5+ cells away. |

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy** (for probability matrix operations)
- **Tkinter** (for graphical user interface)
